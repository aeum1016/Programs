When is it used:
  Organize data into a tree.
  Every parent is larger than or equal to its children
  Need to quickly get the max element.

Implementation:
  Most often a Binary (Max) Heap.
  Must be complete.
  Often 1-indexed aarray of size n+1
  Navigate from parent to child and vice versa, using i<<1 and (i<<1)+1 or i>>1.

  C++ priority_queue (Max Heap)
      priority_queue <int, vector<int>, greater<int>> (Min Heap)
      or just negative everything.

Notes:
  Insert and takeMax is O(log(n)) due to heapify.
  Important for Prim's and Kruskal's for Minimum Spanning tree
  And for Dijkstra's for Single-Source Shortest Paths
  And A* Search
  Used in C++ partial_sort O(nlogk) or heap_sort O(nlogn)

Operations:
  push
  pop
  empty
