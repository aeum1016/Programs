When is it used:
  Very fast, O(1) insertion, search/retrieval/update, or removal;

Implementation:
  Requires a good Hash Function and Collision resolution mechanism.
  CRM - Open Addressing (eg. double hashing), Closed Addressing (eg. separate chaining)

  C++ unordered_map (key -> satellite)
  C++ unordered_set (key)

Notes:
  Can preset initial size to 2xM to reduce re-hashing
  Use the alternative constructor for this.

Operations:
  Set
    insert
    find
    count
    erase
    clear
  Map 
    Set operations
    []


Direct Addressing table
  When is it used:
    Simpler form of a hash table
    A hash table where the keys themselves are the indices
    Can be used if keys are unique and can be assigned values.
