Method:
  Linear search

Run Time:
  O(n)

Explanation:
  Consider every item from index 0 to n-1

Method:
  Binary search

Run Time:
  O(log(n))

Explanation:
  Use lower_bound, upper_bound, or binary_search in C++ algorithms
  Sort first if unsorted

Method:
  Hashing

Run Time:
  O(1)

Explanation:
  Useful when fast access is necessary and order is not
