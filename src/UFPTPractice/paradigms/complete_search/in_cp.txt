Some Complete-Search algorithms are clever and fast

Iterative approaches are used when one can derive the different
states easily with some formula relative to a certain counter
and all states have to be checked.

Recursive backtracking is used when it is hard to derive the
different states with a simple index or one wants to heavily
prune the search space.

Rules of Thumb to identiy Complete Search problems
	1. Asks to print all answers and the solution space can be
	as big as the search space
	2. Has small search space (worst case < 100M)
	3. Suspiciously large time limit constaint and lots of pruning
	potential
	4. Can be pre-calculated
	5. Is a known NP-hard/complete problem
